# DataCo Supply Chain Analytics
 
## Goal:
The goal of this project is to investigate the operational efficiency of supply chains used by DataCo Global to surface recommendations on cost and delivery delay reductions.

## Dataset Structure:
The dataset consisted of one table including information about customers, store locations, shipping locations, delivery status, among other variables.

## Insights Summary:
**In order to evaluate the operational efficiency and analyze sales, we focused on the following key metrics:**
- **Order Fulfillment Time:** Order Shipping Date - Order Placement Date. This helps measure how fast a supply chain can handle shipping.
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** The percent of deliveries that arrive on-time to their destination.
- **Order Item Profit Ratio:** The profit made from an order divided by the product price of the order before any discounts. This helps assess how profitable an item is relative to its price.
